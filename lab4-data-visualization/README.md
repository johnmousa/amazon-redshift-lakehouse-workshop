## 4. Visualize your data Lab

Now that you've built an analytical landscape utilizing Amazon S3 as yor scalable and convenient storage. 
We need now to start visualizing insights form your data.

For this you can utilize your preferred business intelligence tooling like Tableau and Qlik. 
Or you can also use [Amazon QuickSight](https://aws.amazon.com/quicksight/), 
a scalable, serverless, embeddable, machine learning-powered business intelligence (BI) service built for the cloud. 
QuickSight lets you easily create and publish interactive BI dashboards that include Machine Learning-powered insights. 
QuickSight dashboards can be accessed from any device, 
and seamlessly embedded into your applications, portals, and websites.
